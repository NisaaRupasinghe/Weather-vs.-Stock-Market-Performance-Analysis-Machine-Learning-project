# Weather-vs.-Stock-Market-Performance-Analysis-Machine-Learning-project

This project investigates whether weather conditions have any measurable influence on stock market performance. Using Python-based data analysis techniques, the study explores correlations, statistical relationships, and patterns between meteorological variables and stock returns.

## 📌 Objectives  
- Analyze the connection between weather conditions and stock market performance  
- Perform data cleaning, preprocessing, and merging of datasets  
- Explore trends and visualize patterns  
- Build statistical and regression models  
- Present insights on whether weather affects market behavior

## 🔍 Project Workflow  

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**  
- Cleaned and merged weather and stock datasets  
- Handled missing values  
- Converted date formats and aligned time-series data  

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Visualized temperature, humidity, rainfall, and stock trends  
- Identified patterns and seasonal behavior  
- Generated correlation heatmaps and scatter plots  

### 3. **Modeling & Statistical Analysis**  
- Correlation and regression analysis  
- Evaluated whether weather indicators correlate with stock movement  
- Identified weak or strong relationships  

### 4. **Visualization**  
- Time-series plots  
- Scatter plots  
- Heatmaps  
- Trend comparison graphs

## 📈 Key Insights  
- Weather variables show (based on your results) limited-to-moderate correlation with stock market performance  
- Certain weather conditions may show mild effects on daily returns  
- Stock performance appears to be influenced more by economic factors than weather
